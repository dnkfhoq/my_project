RELEASE News of rcssserver3d-0.7.8

New changes for the RoboCup 2025 competition:

* Rule Changes:
    - A new foul perceptor has been added to the Nao robot. It allows an agent
      to sense its own fouls. As an example, a message sent to the agent might
      contain "(foul 8)" if a ball holding foul was called. Fouls of other
      players are not perceived.
    - Ball holding penalties will now be issued regardless of the opponent's
      position.
    - The kick pass effector has been removed from the Nao robot.

* Bug Fixes:
    - The catch effector now uses the global time of the simulation server
      (instead of the game time) to determine the beginning/end of the cooldown
      phase.
